# Milestone-Project-2
This project analyzes and visualizes the New York Air Qualitiy Dataset I found on Data.gov. In this second part of the project, I had a few questions that I wanted to explore and answer.

In project 1, I analyzed a New York Air Quality Dataset I downloaded from the data.gov website. The dataset contains information on New York City air quality surveillance data.

The three questions I was curious to explore after learning about my data are as follows:
1. Is the mean concentration of PM2.5 significantly different from a specific value (e.g., 10 µg/m³)?
2. Is there a significant difference in the mean concentration of PM2.5 between two different regions (e.g., Southeast Queens and Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge)?
3. Is there a significant difference in the mean concentration of NO2 between summer and winter seasons?

**Question 1: Is the mean concentration of PM2.5 significantly different from 10 µg/m3?**
One Sample t-test
data : pm25_data$data_value
t = -8.7755, df = 637, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis : true mean is not equal to 10
95 percent confidence interval : (9.117467, 9.440214)
sample estimates (mean of x) : 9.27884

**Hypothesis:**
Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean concentration of PM2.5 is equal to 10 µg/m³.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean concentration of PM2.5 is not equal to 10 µg/m³.
Test Results:
t-value (t): -8.7755
  o This is the test statistic. A large absolute value of the t-statistic indicates a large difference between the sample mean and the         specified value (10 µg/m³) relative to the variability in the sample.
Degrees of Freedom (df): 637
  o This value is used to determine the critical value of t from the t-distribution.
p-value: < 2.2e-16
  o The p-value is extremely small (essentially zero), which indicates that the observed difference in means is highly statistically           significant.
Alternative Hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 10
  o This confirms that the test was two-tailed, checking for any difference (not just greater or less).
95% Confidence Interval: 9.117467 to 9.440214
  o This interval does not include 10, which further supports the rejection of the null hypothesis. It indicates that we are 95% confident     that the true mean concentration of PM2.5 lies within this range.
Sample Estimate:
  o Mean of x: 9.27884
Interpretation:
  o Statistical Significance: The p-value is much smaller than the common significance level of 0.05, hence the null hypothesisis is           rejected. This means there is a statistically significant difference between the mean concentration of PM2.5 and the specified value of     10µg/m³.
  o Direction of Difference: The negative t-value and the confidence interval indicate thatthe mean concentration of PM2.5 (9.27884 µg/m³)     is significantly lower than 10 µg/m³.
  o Practical Significance: The difference in means (approximately 0.72 µg/m³) is relatively small but statistically significant. This         suggests that while the mean concentration of PM2.5 is slightly lower than 10 µg/m³, the difference is consistent enough to be detected     with high confidence.
  
**Conclusion**
The analysis indicates that the average PM2.5 concentration in the dataset is significantly lower than the specified value of 10 µg/m³. This finding could have implications for air quality standards and regulations, suggesting that the current levels are slightly better than the benchmark value. However, the difference is small, so continuous monitoring and efforts to reduce PM2.5 levels further would still be beneficial for public health.

**Question 2: Is there a significant difference in the mean concentration of PM2.5 between Southeast Queens and Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge?** 
Welch Two Sample t-test
data: pm25_sq$data_value and pm25_bb$data_value
t = -1.0639, df = 47.728, p-value = 0.2927
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval: (-1.3594704, 0.4187296)
sample estimates (mean of x , mean of y) : (7.90000, 8.37037)
**Hypothesis:**
Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean concentration of PM2.5 in Southeast Queens is equal to that in Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean concentration of PM2.5 in Southeast Queens is not equal to that in Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge.
Test Results:
t-value (t): -1.0639
  o This is the test statistic. A t-value close to zero indicates that the sample means are close to each other relative to the variability     in the samples.
Degrees of Freedom (df): 47.728
  o This value is used to determine the critical value of t from the t-distribution.
p-value: 0.2927
  o The p-value is greater than the common significance level of 0.05, indicating that the observed difference in means is not                  statistically significant.
Alternative Hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
  o This confirms that the test was two-tailed, checking for any difference (not just greater or less).
95% Confidence Interval: -1.3594704 to 0.4187296
  o This interval includes zero, which further supports the failure to reject the null hypothesis. It indicates that we are 95% confident     that the true difference in means lies within this range.
Sample Estimates:
Mean of x (Southeast Queens): 7.90000
Mean of y (Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge): 8.37037
**Interpretation:**
1. Statistical Significance: The p-value is 0.2927, which is greater than the common significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis is not rejected. This means there is no statistically significant difference between the mean PM2.5 concentrations in Southeast Queens and Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge.
2. Confidence Interval: The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means ranges from -1.3594704 to 0.4187296. Since this interval includes zero, it further supports the conclusion that there is no significant difference between the two means.
3. Practical Significance: The mean PM2.5 concentration in Southeast Queens is 7.90000 µg/m³, while in Bensonhurst - Bay Ridge it is 8.37037 µg/m³. The difference in means (approximately 0.47 µg/m³) is small and not statistically significant.
   
**Conclusion:**
The analysis indicates that there is no significant difference in the mean PM2.5 concentrations between Southeast Queens and Bensonhurst Bay Ridge. This suggests that the air quality, in terms of PM2.5 levels, is similar in these two regions. Therefore, any interventions or policies aimed at improving air quality may not need to differentiate between these two areas based on PM2.5 concentrations alone.
Question 3: Is there a significant difference in the mean concentration of NO2 between summer and winter seasons?
Welch Two Sample t-test
data: no2_summer$data_value and no2_winter$data_value
t = -32.063, df = 1113.2, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval: ( -9.636563, -8.525166)
sample estimates (mean of x ,mean of y) : (16.87957, 25.96043)
**Hypothesis:**
Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean concentration of NO2 in summer is equal to that in winter.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean concentration of NO2 in summer is not equal to that
in winter.
Test Results:
t-value (t): -32.063
  o This is the test statistic. A large absolute value of the t-statistic indicates a large difference between the sample means relative to     the variability in the samples.
Degrees of Freedom (df): 1113.2
  o This value is used to determine the critical value of t from the t-distribution.
p-value: < 2.2e-16
  o The p-value is extremely small (essentially zero), which indicates that the observed difference in means is highly statistically           significant.
Alternative Hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
  o This confirms that the test was two-tailed, checking for any difference (not just greater or less). 
95% Confidence Interval: -9.636563 to -8.525166
  o This interval does not include zero, which further supports the rejection of the null hypothesis. It indicates that we are 95%             confident that the true difference in means lies within this range.
Sample Estimates:
Mean of x (summer): 16.87957
Mean of y (winter): 25.96043
**Interpretation:**
1. Statistical Significance: The p-value is much smaller than the common significance
level of 0.05, so the null hypothesis is rejected. This means there is a statistically
significant difference between the mean NO2 concentrations in summer and winter.
2. Direction of Difference: The negative t-value and the confidence interval indicate that the mean NO2 concentration in summer (16.88 ppb) is significantly lower than in winter (25.96 ppb).
3. Practical Significance: The difference in means (approximately 9.08 ppb) is substantial, suggesting that NO2 levels are higher in winter compared to summer. This could be due to various factors such as increased heating activities and different atmospheric conditions in winter.
**Conclusion:**
The analysis indicates that there is a significant seasonal variation in NO2 concentrations, with higher levels in winter compared to summer. This finding could have important implications for air quality management and public health policies, suggesting that more stringent measures may be needed during the winter months to control NO2 emissions and protect public health.
